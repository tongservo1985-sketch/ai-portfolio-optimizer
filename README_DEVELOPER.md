# Backend API: Dynamic Generation Logic

## How it works
1. **Brief Ingestion**: The `portfolios/generate` endpoint receives a raw job description.
2. **AI Analysis**: We use GPT-4 to convert the messy job description into structured JSON "Design DNA" (Styles, Industry, Deliverables).
3. **Semantic Matching**: Our `PortfolioGenerator` service queries the `assets` table. It compares the AI-extracted requirements against the `tags` generated by the Computer Vision pipeline during the upload phase.
4. **Scoring**: Assets are ranked by a weighted heuristic (Category > Style > Industry).
5. **Persistence**: A unique `portfolio` record is created, linking the subset of assets, which can then be served via a dynamic URL.

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.10+
- `POSTGRES_URL` must be set in `.env`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` required for brief analysis.
